# set-default-browser

`set-default-browser` is a tool to set the default browser on OS X from
the command line. AFAICT there is no easy way to do this so I always
ended up changing the defaults via Safari's preferences.

Example usage:

      set-default-browser /Applications/Firefox.app

## WARNING

This is still extremely rough and may ruin your day.
